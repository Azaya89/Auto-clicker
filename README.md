# Auto-click program.

This is a simple python script that activates a mouse event. On running the program and activating the mouse event via a keyboard press or left mouse press, there is continous auto_clicking of the mouse with a delay of 0.001 seconds until the program is terminated via another keyboard press.

It is advisable to run the program in a virtual environment in order not to interfere with other possible programs on a local system. The program can also be run even if the IDE is terminated or minimised.


## How to activate and run the program.

- Run the script via the command line (or via your IDE)

- Press **s** to start the mouse event (auto-clicking).

- Press **s** to terminate the mouse event.
